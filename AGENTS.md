# elixir-biohackathon-2026-test (our fork) — Developer Reference

<!--
  Our fork's AGENTS.md: upstream's project guide merged with the template of thodkatz/agent-methodology. Edit
  freely outside the methodology blocks. Inside them (between a "methodology:" marker and its "/methodology:" one),
  `methodology sync` owns the text: set a value in .claude/methodology.json, or deviate in Overrides. The shared
  guides and scripts live in .methodology/, a link to this machine's methodology install: never edit them
  (Working Conventions).

<!-- methodology: entry-point -->
**This file is the entry point, not the whole manual.** It holds only what every session needs: the working
conventions, current work, the shape of the workflow and how to run things. Everything else lives in the files
below; read one only when your task matches its *Read when* column. AGENTS.md and these files are one
instruction set: each rule lives in exactly one of them, so update the file that owns it, never a copy.

## Read on demand

<!-- methodology: read-on-demand -->
| File | Read when |
|---|---|
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/sessions-and-context.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/sessions-and-context.md) | the context-budget hook fires, you start a session from a handoff, you start an investigation or audit, or you hand work to a subagent: the budget, the start routine, mid-unit handoffs, investigation scope |
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/unattended-sessions.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/unattended-sessions.md) | you start, watch or end an unattended session, attach to one, or act on an inbox item |
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/development-workflow.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/development-workflow.md) | you start a change, spike or spec, or claim, open, review, advance or merge any PR: modes, stages, handoffs, deferred items, claiming, local or CI review, merge and cleanup, slicing, agent automation |
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/forge-github.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/forge-github.md) | you run a step on the forge (claim, ready, comment, label, merge, issues) or check what must pass before a merge: the command for each |
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/spec-and-plan-layout.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/spec-and-plan-layout.md) | you write, extend or split a spec or plan, add a clarification, hand a slice to a subagent, or work from a spec or plan that is a directory |
| [`.methodology/shared/guides/tooling-gotchas.md`](.methodology/shared/guides/tooling-gotchas.md) | a command or tool fails (`gh`, `fj`, `git`, Claude Code, the runners, agent-action's CI reviewers): known failures in every repo, and the command that works; then this machine's notes, the `.methodology/machines/<kind>.md` the session-start hook names (`methodology: machine <kind>, …`), and this repo's own for it, `docs/knowledge/machines/<kind>.md`, when it has one |
| [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) | you look for a spec, plan, investigation or reference: the index of everything under `docs/` |
| [`docs/knowledge/README.md`](docs/knowledge/README.md) | you start non-trivial work in an area, or a command or tool fails: as-you-go gotchas and workarounds (see *Project knowledge*) |
| [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md) | you start a unit, triage, or look for known unscheduled problems |
<!-- /methodology: read-on-demand -->

| File | Read when |
|---|---|

| [`platform/ansible/README.md`](platform/ansible/README.md) | you change what an instance plants, deploys or hardens |
| [`docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`](docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md) | you port fork work to upstream, or merge `upstream/main` into our `main`: the worktree, the filtered patch, the checks, opening and tracking the PR |

Decisions behind the work (scope, threat × profile experiments) are the knowledge records of the parent
repository `biohackathon` (`knowledge/`, e.g. 0011 and 0013), which pins this fork as a submodule.

## Keep each session small

<!-- methodology: keep-sessions-small -->
Context is the scarce resource: every request re-reads the whole conversation, and quality drops as it grows.
So a session does one bounded piece of work and hands off:

- **Budget: `AGENT_CONTEXT_BUDGET` tokens of context per session** (150k in `.claude/settings.json`). Past it, the
  context-budget hook tells you so; the status line (`.methodology/shared/claude/statusline.sh`) shows it
  all along. Finish the current step, write the handoff (a new file in the plan's `handoffs/`, made by
  `methodology handoff new <dir> <slug>`, a knowledge note or the investigation's output),
  commit, and end the session, **even in the middle of a unit**. The next session
  starts fresh from the handoff; with `AGENT_AUTO_CONTINUE=true`, start it yourself with
  `methodology next <handoff path>` (it launches the next session on agent-deck), then stop. A new parallel
  session (a fresh unit's worktree) starts only with `methodology next --new "<prompt>"`, never a bare
  `claude`/`claudeN`: only a session `methodology next` starts is on agent-deck, where `methodology status` and the
  supervisor see it and `methodology next --resume` brings it back.
- **A fresh session starts the same way every time:** read the handoff (only the newest:
  `methodology handoff newest <plan>/handoffs` when the unit has a plan, else
  `methodology handoff newest docs/handoffs`, if there is one), `git status`, `git log --oneline -5`, `methodology worktree --prune` (ended units' worktrees, a merged or closed PR's too, never under a live session; on Forgejo with the merges it left open closed first, and the main checkout up to its upstream),
  `BACKLOG.md`'s *Next* (due on any track, or waiting on the user), then work.
  A user saying *continue* (*continue with the handoff*) means this routine, in this session: `methodology next`
  runs only at the budget, and `methodology next --unit` only at a unit's end.
- **Other sessions are the supervisor's, not yours.** Don't watch or poll other sessions with `methodology status` (one
  check that a session you just started came up is fine), and rescue one only when the user asks or the
  supervisor can't reach it: the supervisor's timer (`supervise.sh`) reports unattended ones to the inbox, and a person acts on
  them and on their own. A handoff never asks the next session to watch one (`sessions-and-context.md`, *Other sessions are not a
  session's work*).
- **Investigations and audits are scoped.** Each one answers a written question into a file. Wide reading
  goes to subagents, which return short summaries; a repo-wide audit is a fan-out of scoped subagent tasks
  plus one synthesis session.

Details and the reasons: `.methodology/shared/guides/sessions-and-context.md`.
<!-- /methodology: keep-sessions-small -->

## Write for progressive disclosure

<!-- methodology: progressive-disclosure -->
The same rule applies to what you write. An agent should be able to read a short index and then open only the
part its task needs. Keep this file short: a rule that only some tasks need goes into the file for those tasks,
with a row in *Read on demand* if it starts a new guide. Don't load a whole spec, plan or `docs/` directory "for
context": read its index or the section your unit names.

- **Parts hold the current design; history lives apart.** A change rewrites the spec section or plan task it
  amends; the reason goes in the spec's clarifications with a status (`folded` or `superseded by …`), and
  progress and provenance go in the plan's slices table and handoffs. Never two live texts for one decision.
- **A change updates every doc it makes stale, in the same commit.** When you remove, rename or reverse
  something (a path, section, command, flag, label, rule or behaviour), grep the repo for it and rewrite each
  current-design text that still says the old thing: `AGENTS.md`, guides, knowledge notes, `BACKLOG.md`, spec
  sections, open plan tasks. History (handoffs, clarifications, investigations, evidence, merged slices) stays
  as written. A doc the diff left stale is a review finding.
- **Large specs and plans are directories**: a `README.md` index plus one file per section or slice, past ~400
  lines for a spec and always for a plan with more than one slice.
- **Whatever grows by appending is built to grow**: a one-line-per-item index, detail apart, a pruning rule.

History apart, large documents, growth, the clarification template and the layout: `.methodology/shared/guides/spec-and-plan-layout.md`.
<!-- /methodology: progressive-disclosure -->

## Working Conventions

<!-- methodology: working-conventions -->
- **Commit after each edit.** After completing an edit to the codebase (one coherent change, not each file
  write), make a git commit scoped to that change, with a clear, descriptive message.
- **Sign-off: kept.** Sign off every commit (DCO): always commit with `git commit -s`, with a `Signed-off-by:`
  line matching the commit author; the forge sheet's *Before a merge* says what checks it. This goes alongside,
  not instead of, the `Co-Authored-By:` trailer *Attribution* names. To fix a branch that's missing sign-offs:
  `git rebase <base> --signoff`, then `git push --force-with-lease`.
- **Attribution: an agent's commit and forge text name its tool.** End the commit message with one
  `Co-Authored-By:` trailer unless the harness already appends one (Claude Code does; Codex does when its git
  attribution feature is on): an opencode session adds `Co-Authored-By: opencode <noreply@opencode.ai>`, a codex
  session that added none itself `Co-authored-by: Codex <noreply@openai.com>`. Alongside, not instead of, any
  sign-off. A PR body, PR comment, review or reply the agent posts ends with one line naming its tool, after any
  `Checks:` line: the footer the harness gives for PR bodies (Claude Code:
  `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`), on comments too, and once, not again where the
  harness already added it; with none, `🤖 Generated with Codex` or `🤖 Generated with opencode`. The agent posts
  as the user, and without it the comment reads as theirs. A script's own report (the supervisor's) is not the
  agent's, and carries none.
- **Spawn subagents freely.** Agents working in this repo have standing permission to spawn subagents without
  asking. This overrides any harness default to spawn only on request. Follow the superpowers skills'
  recommended path:
  - Implement a plan's slice with `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`: a fresh implementer subagent per
    task, the per-task reviews, and a whole-branch final review on the most capable model before the PR opens.
  - Use read-only search agents (`Explore`, `general-purpose`) for broad searches and for scanning
    `docs/knowledge/`, so the reading stays out of your context.
  - Use `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` for independent investigations.
- **Don't stop for approval inside the workflow.** The loop runs unattended: no in-chat check-ins between
  tasks, slices or review rounds. The one approval a full-mode track waits for is its spec, the stage the user
  attends: they write it with the agent and approve it (its PR's `approved` label, or `methodology gate approve` at
  their word in the session). Past the hard size limit the agent adds `large-slice` itself, with its why-one-unit
  (`development-workflow.md`, *Slicing implementation*). Otherwise stop only at a gate the approved spec names, a
  clarification that changes the spec's intent, the floor (a step reverting the repo can't undo: spending money,
  heavy resource requests (those *Setup* lists among them), destroying VMs, infrastructure or data, publishing or
  sending, force-pushing or rewriting `main`, secrets and credentials) or a `next-session.sh` refusal. That list is closed
  (`development-workflow.md`, *Gates*, says what is not a gate), even where a plan or handoff says to ask: decide
  the rest and record the ruling. Never wait by asking in chat: a gate waits on its PR as
  `development-workflow.md`'s *Gates* says: one comment, the `waiting-on-user` label, and a watcher that wakes the
  session when the user answers.
- **Never edit `.methodology/`.** It is a link to the machine's read-only install of agent-methodology. Edits
  there are refused (the files are read-only) and would reach every repo on the machine. Deviate from a shared
  rule in *Overrides*; carry an improvement to agent-methodology as its own change, then `methodology update`
  (agent-methodology's `UPDATING.md`).
<!-- /methodology: working-conventions -->

- **Merges are signed off too**: `git merge --signoff` (`-s` there means `--strategy`). The DCO app checks every
  PR on the fork, so sign off from the first commit: a missing sign-off could only be fixed by rewriting the
  branch, which is not done here (*Overrides*), and PR #1 was merged with DCO red over `7ee1e88`.

## Overrides

Where this repo deviates from a shared guide, one line each: "In this repo, X instead of `<guide>`, *Section*,
because Z." This file wins over the guides in `.methodology/shared/guides/`.

- In this repo, **the checks before a merge are the DCO app, the unit's test commands run locally (*Running
  things*) and `methodology sync --check`** instead of `forge-github.md`, *Before a merge* (tests, lint, DCO and
  `pr-checks.yml` in CI), because the fork has no workflows yet (`BACKLOG.md`). The PR body says what ran.
- In this repo, **a branch missing sign-offs is not rebased and force-pushed** instead of the fix in *Working
  Conventions* above, because pushed branches are not rewritten here (PR #1 was merged with DCO red rather
  than rewritten): sign off from the first commit; a commit pushed without one stays, and the PR says
  so.
- In this repo, **a PR that merges `upstream/main` is merged with a merge commit** instead of the squash in
  `development-workflow.md`, *Review and merge*, step 6, and `forge-github.md`, *Merge*, because a squash drops `upstream/main` as a parent and
  the next upstream merge conflicts on every commit again (`docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`).
- In this repo, **a spec meant to go upstream lives in `docs/specs/`** (upstream's layout), written without links
  to fork-only files, instead of `docs/superpowers/specs/` in `development-workflow.md`, *Full mode*, because it
  then ports unchanged; its plan stays in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. First used by the living AG-UI spec,
  `docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/`.

## Contributing upstream

Our fork's `main` carries fork-only files that upstream must never receive:

    .methodology/  .claude/  BACKLOG.md
    docs/README.md  docs/guides/  docs/knowledge/  docs/investigations/  docs/proposals/  docs/superpowers/
    docs/handoffs/  docs/upstream-ports.md

The guide's exclude list (its step 1) mirrors this list: change both together.

A PR to upstream is cut from `upstream/main` (`git fetch upstream`), carries only project changes
(cherry-picked or re-applied), and must pass this check before it is pushed:

```bash
git diff --name-only upstream/main...HEAD \
  | grep -E '^(\.methodology|\.claude/|BACKLOG\.md|docs/(README\.md|guides/|knowledge/|investigations/|proposals/|superpowers/|handoffs/|upstream-ports\.md))' \
  && echo "fork-only files in this branch: remove them" || echo ok
```

`AGENTS.md` is upstream's file rewritten for the fork: never carry its diff upstream. A project rule upstream
also needs is written into upstream's `AGENTS.md` on the upstream branch, by hand. Code and docs that upstream
also needs (e.g. `platform/`, `threats/`, `README.md`) must not refer to anything fork-only.
Upstream changes come in by merging `upstream/main` into our `main`. The steps for both directions:
`docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`.

## Current work

One line per active track: where it stands, the next unit, and where its handoff is. This section only points
to things. Who is working on what is shown by the open PRs, not here (*Claiming a unit* in the workflow guide).
Each unit's PR updates its track's line; the last slice removes it. An open upstream PR also gets a line while it
is open (`docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`, step 6).

- **Upstream PR kraatz #28** (`contrib/agui-archive-markdown`): archive Markdown wording, autolinks, refusal
  reason, bad timestamps; waits on upstream's review.
- **Upstream PR kraatz #29** (`contrib/agui-chat-ui-polish`): reopened sessions land on their end, menu focus;
  waits on upstream's review.
- **Upstream PR kraatz #30** (`contrib/denbi-example-data-root`): denbi example's local `spe_data_root` and API
  IP; waits on upstream's review.
- **Upstream PR kraatz #31** (`contrib/agui-tool-group-steps`): tool calls grouped across model steps; waits on
  upstream's review.
- **Upstream PR kraatz #32** (`contrib/agui-title-on-send`): a new session titled as its first run starts; waits
  on upstream's review.
- **Not scheduled**: `BACKLOG.md` holds every deferred item without a slice; its *Next*, the ones due soon or
  waiting on the user.

## Project in brief

Threat models for agents in Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and the Ansible automation that builds SPE
evaluation instances.

**On an SPE instance VM** (a portal workspace: `~/spe-frontend/.env` exists and this file sits in `~/sperange`),
read `platform/instance/workspace/AGENTS.md` first. It says what a change needs there (nothing, `spe-apply`, or a
new template), how the person tests it, and how a tested change becomes a template.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `threats/`, `vocabulary.yaml`, `validate.py` | Threat model catalog (`TM-NNN-*.md`, new entries start from `threats/TEMPLATE.md`), its controlled vocabulary and validator |
| `paths/`, `mitigations/` | Paths (`P<n>-*.md`) and mitigations (`<id>.yml`: ladder levels `L<n>` plus contributed ones), both checked by `validate.py` |
| `experiments/`, `check_experiment.py` | A threat and path measured against a mitigation (`<name>.yml`, checked by `validate.py` and `check_experiment.py`; `experiments/README.md` indexes them): the `spe-experiments` Coder template's presets (`platform/coder/experiments-template/`) |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to fill an experiment's slots and send one back as a pull request |
| `platform/ansible/` | Playbooks that create, verify, archive and destroy one SPE instance (`platform/ansible/README.md`) |
| `platform/coder/` | The self-service portal (Coder) that runs those playbooks for participants (`platform/coder/README.md`) |
| `platform/site/` | The landing page and the threat catalog page served next to the portal, built from `threats/` (`platform/site/README.md`) |
| `platform/agui/` | The AG-UI frontend: `pydantic-ai-agent/` (Pydantic AI agent served over AG-UI) and `copilotkit-chat/` (Next.js + CopilotKit chat) |
| `platform/instance/` | What runs on an instance from the repository clone there: the frontend's compose file, `spe-apply`, the workspace instructions for Coder Agents (`platform/instance/README.md`) |
| `platform/promptfoo-evals/` | promptfoo provider, assertions, the controls suite and the agent suite (`agent.yaml`, `tests/*.yaml`) against an instance's agent |
| `platform/report/` | The run report service on the portal VM, behind each workspace's Report button (`platform/report/README.md`) |
| `platform/dev/` | Development helpers: dummy dataset generator, scripted agent, tests for host-side scripts |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | Deploying and using an instance by hand, and its private configuration |
| `docs/specs/`, `docs/plans/` | Design specs and implementation plans |

### Project rules

- **Commit each coherent change** with a short imperative subject, and add a body saying why when the subject doesn't. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` first, and stage files by name rather than with `git add -A`.
- **Never commit secrets**: real instance files (`platform/ansible/instances/*.yml` other than `example.yml` and `*.example.yml`, ignored by git) carry the seed that reproduces every canary. Also never commit `platform/ansible/output/`, `canaries.json`, keys, `clouds.yaml` or `.env` files.
- **Never rewrite `main`'s history or force-push it.**
- **Paid model calls need the human's OK** before they run. On this repository's development VM the agent uses Anthropic with `claude-haiku-5-5`, pinned by `spe_agent_allowed_models` in that VM's instance file (a spend guard for that VM). It is paid: use it only for a one-shot check of a feature, never for repeated runs or a promptfoo suite. Those run on de.NBI (`qwen3.8-27b`), which costs no money, only rate; what needs asking for them is in *Setup*. Other setups choose their own provider and model.
- **Follow the plan's rulings discipline**: when work departs from a plan, record the decision, why, and its cost if wrong in that plan's progress file.

### Worktrees and deploying

Each unit of work runs in its own worktree (*Development workflow*).

The portal VM follows upstream's `main`, not ours (`platform/coder/deploy/sync-template.sh`, on a checkout
cloned from upstream): a merge there changes what participants get within minutes. Our work reaches them through
an upstream PR (`docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`).

Private instance files and `platform/ansible/output/` exist only in the main checkout,
not in a worktree. An instance runs the chat frontend from a clone of this repository
on its VM (`~/sperange`), checked out at `spe_repo_ref`, by default the commit the
controller's checkout is at, so that commit must be pushed. `spe_repo_url` defaults to
upstream (still the old `kraatz` URL, which redirects), which lacks our commits: every instance file used from our checkout sets
`spe_repo_url: https://github.com/thodkatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test.git` (the `*.example.yml` files do not). To
deploy a topic branch before it is merged, push it and run Ansible from the main checkout
with `-e spe_repo_ref=<branch>`, and with `-i <worktree>/platform/ansible/inventory/hosts.yml`
if the branch changes `group_vars` (`docs/knowledge/agui-worktree-deploy-inventory.md`).
Inside a workspace, edits to the clone are live or applied with `spe-apply`
(`platform/coder/README.md`, "Working in a workspace").

When this repository is a submodule (of `biohackathon`), the parent records the
pinned commit; move the pin there after the push.

### Running things

```bash
uv run --with pyyaml python validate.py              # threats, paths, mitigations, experiments
uv run --with pyyaml python check_experiment.py      # one experiment (or every one) will run and fits the catalog
uv run --with pyyaml --with mkdocs-material python platform/site/build.py   # landing page + catalog -> platform/site/dist/
uv run --with pytest --with pyyaml --with mkdocs-material pytest platform/dev/tests -q   # dataset generator, host preflight, site build, archive
(cd platform/agui/pydantic-ai-agent && uv run --group dev pytest -q)   # agent
(cd platform/promptfoo-evals && uv run --group dev pytest -q)          # promptfoo provider and assertions
uv run --with pytest --with markdown pytest platform/report/tests -q    # run report service
(cd platform/agui/copilotkit-chat && npm ci && npm run build)          # chat UI (type check)
(cd platform/agui/copilotkit-chat && npm ci && npm test)               # chat UI (sessions, recorder, API)
cd platform/ansible && ansible-playbook playbooks/create.yml -e @instances/NAME.yml </dev/null
```

Ansible needs a blocking stdin here: always run it with `</dev/null`, from
`platform/ansible/`. The collections come from the system Ansible package.

### Coder portal

`platform/coder/` is a self-service portal (Coder) that runs the playbooks for
participants, proxies the chat frontend into the browser and archives each run on
stop (`platform/coder/README.md`). Testbed presets are `platform/coder/template/testbeds/*.yml`.
A branch named `template/<name>` pushed to upstream (the repository the portal follows) becomes its own portal
template `spe-<name>` within minutes, for trying creation-time changes (Ansible roles, the template) on a
fresh workspace before they are merged.

### AG-UI agent frontend

Built from plan `docs/plans/2026-10-15-agui-frontend.md` and spec
`docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/` (§12: what implementation verified
and changed) on branch `agent-agui-frontend`. The record of the work, every
deviation from the plan with its cost if wrong, and the acceptance evidence is
[`docs/plans/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-progress.md`](docs/plans/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-progress.md).
How to deploy and use it: [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md).

All 13 tasks are done, including the model-backed checks on the development VM
(Anthropic `claude-haiku-5-5`) and on de.NBI (`qwen3.8-27b`). Merged into `main`
on 2026-10-19 together with the Coder portal, which now runs it on every instance
next to Open WebUI (`spe_frontends`, kraatz #16). Chat sessions (sidebar, archive) were added by the *AG-UI chat
sessions* plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-29-agui-chat-sessions/`, done).
The conversation record (journals, the live archive, TM-005) was built by the
*AG-UI conversation record* plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-03-agui-conversation-record/`, done).
The run report is no longer a chat feature: it lives on the portal VM for every frontend (`platform/report/`).

## Development workflow

<!-- methodology: development-workflow -->
Pick the lightest mode that fits, and move up when the work turns out bigger:

- **Direct**: you can describe the diff in one sentence (typo, one-line doc fix, config tweak). Commit to `main`.
- **Change**: a few files, clear approach, no contract others rely on. One PR `change/<slug>`, plan in its body.
- **Spike**: you don't yet know what works. A written question and budget in `docs/investigations/<topic>.md`,
  throwaway code on `spike/<topic>` (never merged); the output is the finding and a recommendation.
- **Full**: more than one slice, a contract or schema change, or costly rework. Three sequential stages, each
  its own branch cut from `origin/main` and its own PR:
  1. **Spec**: `spec/<topic>`, written by the `brainstorming` skill into `docs/superpowers/specs/`. Every
     decision names its acceptance check. **The user approves it** (the `approved` label; in a
     session they are in, the agent adds it with `methodology gate approve`, quoting them).
  2. **Plan**: `plan/<topic>`, written by the `writing-plans` skill into `docs/superpowers/plans/`, with its
     `## PR slices`.
  3. **Implementation**: one small PR per slice, `impl/<topic>-<n>-<slug>`, titled `… (n/N)`.

The rules that bite most often:

- **Look for what exists before you build it**: before a spec or change that adds logic someone maintains,
  search open, on more than one harness, with the needs in the user's terms, and ask the reverse (take the best
  tool whole: what breaks, what layer is left); a close one gets a trial first. Agent-methodology built ~4,000
  lines of session tooling before searching, months after tools that do much of it existed
  (`development-workflow.md`, *Choosing a mode*).
- **Claim before you work**: the unit's branch pushed to `origin` plus a draft PR, worked on in its own worktree,
  `.claude/worktrees/<branch, / as ->` of the main checkout (`methodology worktree <branch>`
  makes it and claims it; `git worktree list` shows them all). **One PR open at a time per track**, and dependent work waits
  until that PR has merged.
- **One review round, by the reviewer in *Reviewers***: local reviewer subagents, or a CI reviewer and, if it's
  out, the fallbacks there, in order; a mechanical PR (a pointer, copied or regenerated files) has none. Address every finding, then **merge it yourself**
  (*Merge*) once every check the forge sheet lists under *Before a merge* passes (and, for a spec, once the
  user has added `approved`). Clean up the worktree and branch afterwards.
- **Hand off, then chain**: every unit ends with a handoff for the next one, riding in its own PR, and updates its
  track's line in *Current work*. Don't start the next unit in the same session: once the PR merged and cleanup is
  done, write a second, short handoff on `main` that names the unit's own handoff (now on `main`, and the next
  session reads only this one) and adds what only the merge settled (its commit, the review round); commit, push
  and start it with `methodology next --unit <next unit's branch> <handoff>` from the main checkout; the track's last unit
  ends with `methodology next --end`. Hand off earlier when the context budget says so. Told to stop ("stop
  here", "finish this, then stop", "pause"), finish the step, commit and push, write a handoff (`methodology
  handoff new`, where the budget's goes), commit and push it, then `methodology next --end`:
  never the handoff form, which chains on.
- **Deferred items land somewhere durable**: rewritten into a planned slice's task text, a new slice, the next
  spec's **Inputs for**, or `BACKLOG.md`. A handoff, PR body or review reply only points.

**Before you start a change, spike or spec, or claim, open, review or advance any PR, read
`.methodology/shared/guides/development-workflow.md`.**
<!-- /methodology: development-workflow -->

In this repo:

- **Every PR targets our fork**: `gh pr create --repo thodkatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test --base main`.
  Without `--repo`, `gh` may pick upstream.
- **The review round is local** (*Reviewers*); **the user approves specs** (the `approved` label); the
  session merges every other PR itself once the checks in *Overrides* pass.
  Address the round's findings and any comment the user leaves, each in its own thread. Clean up the worktree and
  branch after the merge, then move the pin in `biohackathon` (*Worktrees and deploying*).

## Reviewers

- **`local`**: reviewer subagents in the working session (`development-workflow.md`, *Review and merge*, *Local
  review*: at least the correctness and methodology focuses), findings posted on the PR as one comment; no CI
  reviewer yet (`BACKLOG.md`). The user can still review any PR.

## Project knowledge

<!-- methodology: project-knowledge -->
As you work, capture anything you learn that isn't already visible from the code or `git log`: a workaround, a
constraint that isn't obvious from reading the file, why an approach was rejected, a gotcha that cost real time.
Keep an index at `docs/knowledge/README.md`, one line per entry pointing to `docs/knowledge/<topic>.md` (not the
`docs/knowledge/machines/<kind>.md` files below, which the hook names). Skim the index before non-trivial work in
an area; open a linked file only when it's relevant. Write notes alongside the change they relate to; no separate
PR is needed. Don't record what the code or history already shows.

- **When something fails, look before you debug:** grep `docs/knowledge/`,
  `.methodology/shared/guides/tooling-gotchas.md` and the machine's notes (the files the session-start hook names:
  `.methodology/machines/<kind>.md`, and this repo's `docs/knowledge/machines/<kind>.md` when it has one) for the
  command, tool or error text; under `docs/knowledge/machines/`, only this machine's file applies. The next
  session should go straight to the fix someone already found. A failed Bash command does part of it for you: the
  failed-command hook adds the notes and guide sections that share the error's wording (index lines and note
  bodies) to your context. Read what it adds before you debug; when it adds nothing, grep all the same.
- **When you find a workaround, write it down before moving on.** If a command, tool or approach failed and took
  more than one retry to get past, record the symptom (the exact error), the fix, and the command that works.
  Put the command and the exact error text in the index line and the note, so a grep and the hook find it. A
  gotcha in a tool every repo uses, rather than in this project, belongs in `tooling-gotchas.md`; one only this
  kind of machine has, in its `machines/<kind>.md`: carry it to agent-methodology (*Never edit `.methodology/`*),
  and keep a note here until the machine's next `methodology update` brings it in. One only this repo has, and
  only on one kind of machine (a service that needs a workaround there), goes in
  `docs/knowledge/machines/<kind>.md` (`<kind>` is the `AGENT_MACHINE` the hook names), not in `AGENTS.md`, which
  every machine reads.
- **Lessons in a handoff become notes.** A gotcha written only into a handoff or a PR body gets lost;
  write the note and link it from the handoff.
<!-- /methodology: project-knowledge -->

Decisions (what was considered and why) go to `biohackathon`'s `knowledge/` records instead of `docs/knowledge/`.

## Setup

Install and test commands: *Running things*. `.methodology/` is a git-ignored link to the machine's
install of agent-methodology (`methodology setup`; version pinned in `.claude/methodology.json`, moved by
`methodology update`); `methodology doctor` checks it. Without the install the hooks stay off, and nothing else
depends on it.

Quota-heavy runs to ask about before starting (*Don't stop for approval*): **any promptfoo evaluation or other
run that makes paid model calls** (*Project rules*), and **creating or destroying cloud instances**
(`playbooks/create.yml` / `destroy.yml` against de.NBI or another OpenStack).

Standing OK from the user (2026-11-09), so neither is asked about: **one de.NBI instance at a time** may be
created, rebuilt and destroyed without asking, and evaluations on it (de.NBI `qwen3.8-27b`, no cost) may run,
the canary ladder's included. **Anthropic stays a few calls**: on the development VM, only a one-shot check of a
feature (*Project rules*), never a suite or repeats, even though the account has a spend limit. A second
instance, another cloud, or more than a few Anthropic calls still needs the user's OK.
