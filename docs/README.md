# docs/ index

One line per document: what it covers and who reads it. Open the document only when your task needs it.

| Path | What | Read when |
|---|---|---|
| `../.methodology/shared/guides/` | the shared guides: workflow, sessions and context, spec and plan layout (a submodule; never edited here) | see `AGENTS.md`, *Read on demand* |
| `guides/` | this repo's own guides, if any | see `AGENTS.md`, *Read on demand* |
| `knowledge/README.md` | as-you-go gotchas, one line each | before non-trivial work in an area |
| `specs/`, `plans/` | upstream's design specs and plans (the AG-UI frontend), shared with upstream | when working on what they built |
| `superpowers/specs/`, `superpowers/plans/` | our fork's specs and plans (fork-only, `AGENTS.md`, *Contributing upstream*) | when your unit names one |
| `getting-started.md` | deploying and using an instance by hand (upstream's) | before deploying |
| `investigations/` | one file per answered question (`sessions-and-context.md`, *Investigations and audits*) | when the question comes up again |
