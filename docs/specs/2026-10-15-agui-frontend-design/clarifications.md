# Clarifications

The decision log: numbered, append-only, never renumbered. History, not design: each entry's change is already
in the parts it amends.

1. **The spec becomes the living AG-UI spec: §6 holds the chat sessions, §13 and §14 the conversation record**
   (2026-11-03; the fork's PR #19). The single file is split into this directory, one part per section; §6 states
   the sessions, session API and sidebar as built, restated for the record (their journal parts wait for it); §13
   (the record) and §14 (the archive) are added, with the README's decisions table, early output and glossary; §2,
   §3, §5 *History*, §9 and §10 are rewritten where they said the chat keeps no conversation, the client's history
   reaches the agent unchanged, or the chat UI has no tests. *Reason:* the chat sessions and the record were
   designed in separate specs; one spec, kept current, lets the AG-UI work be read, reviewed and ported as one
   package. Chat sessions stored the client's history, which a participant can forge; the record replaces that
   storage (decisions 1–18) and carries the rest of the sessions' design over (decisions 19–30). *Amends:* §2, §3,
   §5 *History*, §6, §9, §10; adds §13, §14. *Status:* folded.

2. **The archive copies live; only the final archive stops the services** (2026-11-03, the user, after #19
   merged). `archive.yml` no longer stops `chat-ui` and the agent: it copies the journals and the run log from
   the running containers, so it can run at any time as a backup without interrupting participants. The stop
   (the barrier) stays only in the archive `destroy.yml` runs (`spe_archive_final: true`), and the services are
   not started again there. The bundle records `live` or `final`. *Reason:* the user wants to archive and back
   up without stopping users; a stop per archive cancels every run in progress. The append-only journal (§13)
   makes a live copy safe: it is an earlier state of each file with at most a torn last line, which the
   rebuild already skips, and a run without `run_end` reads as `incomplete`. *Cost if wrong:* a live archive
   can miss the last second of a run and show runs as `incomplete` that complete later; the final archive
   still has them whole. *Amends:* §14 *Export* and *Write*, decision 30. *Status:* folded.

3. **The archive renders the agent's compaction marker as a section, and `index.md` counts them** (2026-11-03;
   AG-UI compaction, slice 2/3, the fork's PR #18). An assistant text message whose id starts with
   `spe-compaction-` is rendered as `## Compacted`, the line "From here the model saw this summary instead of the
   messages above." and the summary in a fence; `index.md`'s columns become `# | Session | Tags | Created | Runs |
   Compactions | State`. *Reason:* the agent compacts a conversation that no longer fits the model's context and
   marks the point in the session's messages (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-03-agui-compaction-design.md`, §7,
   clarification 1). It was written as the chat sessions spec's clarification 8 on that branch, which #19's fold
   took first. *Amends:* §14, the archive as built (`index.md` columns). *Status:* folded.

4. **The feasibility sample comes from the built server once the journal is wired; the first slice shows the
   verdict at the runtime level** (2026-11-03; the fork's PR #20, the conversation record's plan). *Early output*'s
   first sample (the built server, a `curl` with a fabricated turn and a forged marker, `fake_agent.py`'s echo, the
   journal lines) is shown when the journal is wired into the run route, not in the first slice; the first slice
   shows the verdict through CopilotKit's runtime handler and a real `HttpAgent`, a middleware that replaces the
   history deciding what the agent receives, and stops the work for the user's decision if it does not. *Reason:*
   the journal lines and `fake_agent.py`'s echo of what it received exist only once the journal and the run route
   are built; the runtime-level test answers the same question (can `chat-ui` replace the history?) before any of
   that is built, which is what the early sample is for. *Cost if wrong:* the user sees the sample with journal
   lines one slice later than the spec said; a negative verdict still stops the work in the first slice.
   *Amends:* README, *Early output*. *Status:* folded.

5. **`spe_agui_source_dir` is `platform/agui`, not the repository root** (2026-11-03; the fork's PR #18 rewrote
   §7, PR #20 records it). §7's default is `{{ playbook_dir }}/../../agui`, the directory holding
   `pydantic-ai-agent/` and `copilotkit-chat/`; a deploy from another checkout passes
   `-e spe_agui_source_dir=<checkout>/platform/agui`. *Reason:* the platform moved under `platform/`, and the
   `agui` role stages `pydantic-ai-agent` and `copilotkit-chat` relative to this directory, so the repository
   root made `create.yml` fail. *Amends:* §7, the `agui` role's variables. *Status:* folded.

6. **Classification reads decision 2 literally where §13 left it open: a known, unchanged message off the
   anchor's path is not recorded** (2026-11-03; conversation record, slice 1/4). §13 *The run route*, step 2 now
   states: the anchor is the client message the journal added last, not the last in the client's order; a run's
   last message is not a run boundary while a tool call that run made has no result in that run; the messages
   cut when the anchor moves back are `deleted` even if the client sent them; a message without a string id is
   `fabricated`, and a repeated new id counts once; `ignored` lists the client's messages first, then `deleted`
   in path order; a known message whose compared fields equal the journal's is not recorded, even off the
   anchor's path (a message resent from another branch). *Reason:* the record keeps what reached the agent and
   what the client sent that differs; an unchanged known message differs in nothing, the journal already holds
   it verbatim, and `run_start.anchor` shows which branch the run continued; a reordered history must not raise
   false alarms. *Cost if wrong:* an analyst cannot see in the journal that a client resent an unchanged message
   from another branch; recording it later is one more `ignored` kind and its rendering in `write_run.py`,
   absent from journals written before. *Amends:* §13 *The run route*, step 2; decision 2. *Status:* folded.

7. **A run without `run_end` is no boundary at its last message, nothing after a run's first `run_end` is applied,
   and new messages count from the anchor's position as the client sent it** (2026-11-03; conversation record,
   slice 1/4's review round, the fork's PR #22). §13 *The run route*, step 2 states the first and third,
   *Rebuilding the conversation* the second. *Reason:* while a run streams, its newest message holds no tool call
   yet, so a second run (§13, *Concurrency and branches*) could anchor at that partial reply; the first run then
   attaches a tool call to it with the result on its own branch, and a later run on the second branch sends the
   agent a dangling call. Lines after a run's first `run_end`, which only a damaged or hand-edited journal holds,
   could do the same to an ended run another run is anchored at. The cutoff for new messages was left open by
   clarification 6; the code counts from the anchor's place in the client's history before it moves back, the
   stricter reading (fewer messages count as new, the rest `fabricated`). *Cost if wrong:* a run that anchors at a
   still-streaming or crashed run's reply moves back to that run's user message and records the reply `deleted`, an
   alarm an analyst must read past; a damaged journal's late lines are left out of the rebuild, though the
   archive's raw journal keeps them. *Amends:* §13 *The run route*, step 2, and *Rebuilding the conversation*;
   decision 2. *Status:* folded.

8. **The archive's chat file also shows the messages off the active branch; the exported chat names a run's
   error, folds an anchor into its run's message and never reuses a client id** (2026-11-03; AG-UI conversation
   record, slice 2/4). `chats/NN-<slug>.md` renders the branch along `currentId`, then a section "Other branches"
   with every other message in record order, each naming the message it follows, with the same status lines and
   ignored blocks; `index.md` has the AG-UI columns `# | Session | Tags | Created | Runs | Compactions | State`.
   In the exported chat, `spe_run` also carries `error` (from `run_end.error`), which the status line shows; a
   run's `content` is its text joined without a compaction marker's summary, which stays its own `message` item;
   a run's message is `spe-run-<run id>`, and an anchor folded into an earlier run's message makes that run's
   message the parent; a client message id that is already exported, or starts with `spe-run-` or `spe-msg-`,
   is exported under a fresh `spe-msg-<n>` id with `spe_original_id`. *Reason:* a refused run adds no message,
   so it is never on the tip's branch, and two tabs make sibling branches; rendering only the active branch would
   hide a refused run's status and ignored content, which decision 16 says the archive shows. A failed run's
   reason belongs in the archive next to its status. Open WebUI shows a run's `content` as the reply, which the
   summary is not. An anchor is an AG-UI message id, and an assistant one lives inside its run's exported
   message. A client-chosen id equal to its own run's message, or to another exported id, could make a message
   its own ancestor and hang the walk along `currentId`. *Amends:* §14 *The Open WebUI chat* and *Write*.
   *Status:* folded.

9. **`GET /api/sessions/{id}` no longer answers `last_run_at`** (2026-11-03; AG-UI conversation record,
   slice 3/4, task 1). §6's row for that call drops the field; it stays on `GET /api/sessions`'s list rows.
   *Reason:* `last_run_at` tells a client its run was journaled apart from a metadata change, which a list
   row needs to reconcile after a run (decision 26); one session's own view does not, and the store's `get()`
   builds `SessionView` as `SessionMeta` without it rather than carrying a field nothing reads. *Cost if
   wrong:* a caller that read `last_run_at` off `GET /api/sessions/{id}` gets `undefined`; none does today.
   *Amends:* §6, the `GET /api/sessions/{id}` row. *Status:* folded.

10. **Activity messages on the journal's path are neither sent to the agent nor counted `deleted`** (2026-11-03;
    AG-UI conversation record, slice 3/4, task 2). §13 *The run route*, step 2 leaves every `role: "activity"`
    message out of the path it classifies against, and step 5 sends the agent that path. *Reason:* `@ag-ui/client`
    1.0.2's `AbstractAgent.prepareRunAgentInput` drops every activity message from a run's input, so the browser
    never sends one back, and counting it `deleted` would raise a false alarm on every run after one that emitted
    an `ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT`; the recorder calls the agent itself, past that filter, so without this the agent would
    get an activity message no other run's input can carry. *Cost if wrong:* a client that dropped an activity
    message on purpose is not recorded as having done so, and a `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` sent after ignored content
    lacks activity messages (the browser keeps its own, which the snapshot does not mark authoritative); recording
    them later is a change to `classify` alone. *Amends:* §13 *The run route*, steps 2 and 5; decision 2.
    *Status:* folded.

11. **The conversation record is built; the archive exports the journals, and every archive still runs the
    barrier** (2026-11-03; AG-UI conversation record, slice 3/4). `chat-ui` keeps `/data/sessions/<uuid>.jsonl`
    (§13) and serves §6's session API from it; `archive.yml` copies the journals and the run log, exports the
    journals with the chat UI's exporter and renders them with `write_run.py` (§14); `<uuid>.json` and
    `write_agui_run.py` are gone. Until the live copy is built, every archive stops `chat-ui` and then the agent
    before the copy and starts them again after it, as the archive of the chat sessions did, and the bundle says
    `final`. (`GET /api/sessions/{id}` without `last_run_at` is clarification 9.) *Reason:* the record and its
    archive ship together, so `main` never holds journals the archive cannot render; the live copy (decision 30)
    follows separately. *Cost if wrong:* until the live copy, an archive taken while participants work pauses
    their runs for the copy (a run in progress ends `cancelled`), as it did before the record. *Amends:* the
    README's status line and the note above the decisions table, §14 (the paragraph on the archive as built, the
    last paragraph of *Why a live copy is consistent*). *Status:* folded.

12. **`/compact` is a command run: `chat-ui` journals it as a command, the agent compacts** (2026-11-03; the
    user, the fork's PR #26). §15 adds compaction on request: a run whose only new message is `/compact
    [focus]` is journaled with a `command`, never as a message; `chat-ui` sends the agent the path and
    `forwardedProps.spe_command`; the agent makes one summary request and returns the marker; a marker cut short
    is no cut point; the archive says the participant asked for it. Considered: a separate agent endpoint with
    `chat-ui` writing the marker as a new journal line (a second kind of marker for the rebuild, the exporter
    and the archive), and the agent recognising a `/compact` user message (the command stays in the history as
    the participant's words, and compaction decision 4 would keep it as the latest request). *Reason:* the
    user's request (2026-11-03, PR #21) that the command never be stored as a user message, and what other
    tools do: Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI and Open WebUI all treat a manual compaction as a
    command, Open WebUI's offered only while its compaction is on. Decision 3 still refuses a client request
    with no new user message: a command run has one, the `/compact`, which `chat-ui` turns into a command.
    Decision 39's model-backed check runs on de.NBI's `qwen3.8-27b`, the platform participants use, at the
    user's request, not on the development VM's model. *Cost if wrong:* a participant who wants the literal text
    `/compact …` sent to the model cannot send it; the `/compact` bubble disappears when the run starts, which
    could read as a lost message (the early output shows it). *Amends:* §5 *Endpoints*, §13 (intro, *The run
    route* steps 2, 4 and 5), decisions 2, 5 and 6, the README (status, decisions 31–39, early output,
    glossary, parts), `out-of-scope.md`, `inputs-for-plan.md`; adds §15. *Status:* folded.
