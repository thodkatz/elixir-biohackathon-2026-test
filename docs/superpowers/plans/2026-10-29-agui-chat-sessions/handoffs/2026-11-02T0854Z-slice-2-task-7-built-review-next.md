# 2026-11-02T1200Z: slice 2, the Open WebUI polish is built; task 7's review is next

**State.** Slice 2 (`impl/agui-chat-sessions-2-sidebar`, draft PR #10, worktree `../wt-agui-2-sidebar`). On
2026-11-02 the user asked for the sidebar's focus bugs to be fixed and for Open WebUI's look, polished like
claude.ai and chatgpt.com, with identical tag features and no banner sentence in the header. That became spec
clarification 4 and plan tasks 6–8 (`30c119b`, `45d2774`), run after task 4 and before task 5.

| Task | Commits | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | up to `c45102c` | complete, reviews clean (handoff 1107Z) |
| 6: the menu's behaviour | `c53b8ff` | complete, review clean, 8 minors deferred |
| 7: the look | `25efe86` (move only), `dfae105`, `97c891c`, `b963a69` (screenshots) | **built; task review not run** |
| 8: slice 3's tasks follow clarification 4 | – | not started |
| 5: stale docs, dev VM, PR | – | interrupted earlier; its WIP is in two `git stash` entries (see below) |

**Next steps, in order.**
1. Task 7's task review over `45d2774..b963a69` (brief, report and the review template are in the SDD workspace
   `.superpowers/sdd/slice-2-sidebar/`; `progress.md` is the ledger). Screenshots:
   `evidence/ui-{light,dark}-*.png`.
2. Task 8 (docs only). It must also remove the old banner and the hex `.spe-header` rule from
   `slice-3-complete.md` (around lines 34, 972–1065, 1138, 1244–1250), which would undo task 7's look.
3. Task 5: `git stash list` shows two entries, "task-5 WIP: stale-doc rewrites" (tracked edits) and "task-5 WIP:
   knowledge note and evidence (untracked)". Apply both (`git stash pop` twice, newest first), then check them
   against tasks 6–7: the docs must describe the new sidebar, not the first one.
4. The final whole-branch review (most capable model; point it at the ledger's deferred minors), push, ready
   #10, the local review round, then hand off for the user's merge.

**The user's choices (2026-11-02), binding:** Open WebUI's tag approach exactly: tags appear only in the `⋯`
menu's tag editor and in slice 3's `tag:` search, not on the rows. A click anywhere on a pill removes the tag.
Space as a commit key is skipped. New chat is Open WebUI's quiet row, not a button.

**Rulings** (*decision, why, cost if wrong*), all in the ledger as well:

- Clarification 4 and tasks 6–8 before task 5: the user's request. Cost if wrong: rework of the UI tasks.
- A rename is committed by a click outside, but the tag input is not (Open WebUI's rules). Cost if wrong: one
  handler.
- Tags leave the rows, and slice 3's tag chips become `tag:` search. Cost if wrong: slice 3's filter task text.
- The SPE notice becomes CopilotKit's `chatDisclaimerText` under the composer. Cost if wrong: one label.
- Delete keeps the spec's archive sentence in a dialog titled "Delete chat?", in muted red. Cost if wrong: CSS.
- In the tag editor, the arrow keys pick a suggestion and Enter adds it (or the typed text). Cost if wrong: a
  few lines.
- A click outside closes the menu without moving focus to `⋯` (Escape and choosing an item do move it), so focus
  is not taken from the composer. Cost if wrong: one `focus()` call.
- Carried from earlier handoffs: the task 1–4 rulings in handoff 1107Z, and task 4's ruling on the Markdown
  rendering of titles, which goes in the PR body.

**Task 7's concerns, for its review:**
- CopilotKit's dark mode depends on an effect that sets `html.dark`.
- The hidden `⋯` is transparent but still clickable.
- It deliberately differs from Open WebUI in a slightly darker light-mode muted text, a 448 px dialog, a "Tags"
  heading in the editor and a *Pinned* label instead of a folder. The report gives the reasons.

**Housekeeping done on `main` today:** `platform/dev/.gitignore` (`__pycache__/`), three compiled test modules
untracked, and the parent pin moved. `../wt-upstream` is kept: upstream PR kraatz#9 is still open.
