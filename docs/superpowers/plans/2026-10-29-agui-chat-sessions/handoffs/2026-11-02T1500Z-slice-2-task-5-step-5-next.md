# 2026-11-02T1500Z: slice 2, tasks 7 and 8 reviewed, task 5 steps 1–4 done; step 5 (dev VM) is next

**State.** Slice 2 (`impl/agui-chat-sessions-2-sidebar`, draft PR #10, worktree `../wt-agui-2-sidebar`). The
SDD ledger is `.superpowers/sdd/slice-2-sidebar/progress.md` (git-ignored, in the worktree).

| Task | Commits | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4, 6 | up to `c53b8ff` | complete, reviews clean |
| 7: the look | `25efe86`..`b963a69` | complete, review approved (`task-7-review.md`), 5 minors deferred |
| 8: slice 3 follows clarification 4 | `8f8a5ca`, fix `0d86433` | complete; review found one Important (header `⋯` `disabled` during rename swallows the focus that ends it), fixed |
| 5: docs, dev VM, PR | `baec9ff` (steps 1–3), `815d5ca`, `8216c9c` (step 4) | **steps 1–4 done; next: step 5** |

The two task-5 `git stash` entries were applied, checked against tasks 6–7 (the chat UI README's *Sidebar*
paragraph rewritten for the new sidebar) and dropped. The old `evidence/slice-2/` screenshots (first sidebar)
were discarded and retaken.

**Next steps, in order** (the brief is `.superpowers/sdd/slice-2-sidebar/task-5-brief.md`):
1. Task 5 step 5: deploy to the dev VM from the main checkout with `-e spe_agui_source_dir=<worktree>/platform/agui`,
   copy `/var/tmp/spe-e2e-sessions/.` into `chat-ui` (still there from step 4; if not, rerun step 4's
   `sessions.py` without `--shots`), screenshot `06-dev-vm.png`. No model call, no cloud instance.
2. Step 6: `archive.yml` from the worktree; copy `index.md` and `chats/01-*.md` into `evidence/slice-2/`.
3. Step 7: suites, `sync-agents.py --check`, the citation grep; README slices table and *Current work*; the
   `slice-2-done` handoff; push.
4. The final whole-branch review on the most capable model over `origin/main..HEAD`. Point it at the ledger's
   deferred minors (tasks 1–8). Then ready #10 with the brief's body: add the light/dark `evidence/ui-*.png`
   links too, since the user said (2026-11-02) they will judge the look in the PR. Then the local review round,
   and hand off for the user's merge.

**Rulings this session** (*decision, why, cost if wrong*), also in the ledger:
- Task 8's implementer hit a usage limit after finishing the rewrite. The controller committed it without a
  report, after a stale-term grep and a fence check. *Why:* the work was complete and the review checks it.
  *Cost if wrong:* none beyond what the review missed.
- Task 8's fix round was not re-reviewed separately: a 5-line doc change copying slice 2's row pattern, with
  its diff hunks verified by `git apply` on a scratch copy. *Cost if wrong:* slice 3 meets a focus bug its own e2e
  catches.
- The e2e screenshot helper uses `animations="disabled"`. *Why:* the menu was caught mid-fade. *Cost if wrong:*
  none; it changes screenshots only.

**Check command:** `(cd platform/agui/copilotkit-chat && npm ci && npm test && npm run build)`: 70 pass, build ok
at `8216c9c`. `python3 platform/dev/e2e/sessions.py`: 24 `ok`.
