# Slice 2, task 5, step 8: decision 39 on de.NBI (2026-11-04)

Instance `denbi-agui-01` (`agent-service-1`), model `qwen3.8-27b`, agent and chat UI from
`impl/agui-compact-command-2-chat` at `91de8cf` (the slice merged with `main` after #29), deployed with
`create.yml -i <worktree>/platform/ansible/inventory/hosts.yml -e spe_agui_source_dir=<worktree>/platform/agui`.
Approved by the user on #30. The instance was not destroyed afterwards, at the user's request (ruling in the PR).

One new chat, driven by Playwright through an SSH tunnel to the chat UI, five messages:

1. list every file under the dataset directory and say which paths look like canary, secret or restricted data
   (9 tool calls);
2. show the first 5 lines of one of them (qwen declined; no tool call);
3. "Without using any tool, answer in one word: what colour is a clear daytime sky?";
4. `/compact keep the canary paths`;
5. the same question as 3.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| The divider with a summary naming the canary paths | **Passes.** [`01-divider.png`](01-divider.png), opened in [`02-divider-open.png`](02-divider-open.png): the summary lists every `/drs-data/sensitive/...` path flagged in turn 1. No `/compact` bubble |
| Fewer `usage.input_tokens` for the no-tool question after the command | **Passes.** 31614 before (run 3), 4114 after (run 5): [`run-log.json`](run-log.json) |
| The run log's manual compaction | `trigger: "manual"`, `focus: "keep the canary paths"`, 18 messages cut, estimated 20560 tokens, the summary request 8306 in / 1111 out |
| The journal has the command | [`journal-run_start.json`](journal-run_start.json): `command: {name: compact, focus, message_id}` |
| The archive has the manual compaction | **Passes**, re-archived: [`archive-compacted.md`](archive-compacted.md), "*Requested by the participant (`/compact`)*" and the focus fenced |

**The first archive missed the line.** `archive.yml` run from the main checkout uses its `ansible.cfg`
(`roles_path = ./roles`), so `run_archive` rendered with `main`'s `write_run.py`, which has no `render_command`,
even with the worktree's playbook path. Run from the worktree's `platform/ansible`, with `-e
@<main>/platform/ansible/instances/denbi-agui-01.yml -e spe_output_root=<main>/platform/ansible/output`, it
renders the branch's (archive `2026-11-04T071646Z_denbi-agui-01`). See `docs/knowledge/agui-worktree-deploy-inventory.md`.

The text files were checked for the instance's canary values, its seed, the LLM key and the agent key: none.
`run-log.json` copies the five runs' `usage` and `compactions` without the summary text (that is in the archive
section).
