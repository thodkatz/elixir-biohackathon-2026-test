# Slice 2/4: the exporter in the image, and `write_run.py` renders AG-UI chats

Delivers the archive's two halves before anything writes a journal (ruling 2): `lib/export.ts` turns a rebuilt
session into an Open WebUI chat and a directory of journals into the bundle §14 describes;
`scripts/export-journals.ts` runs it, and the `chat-ui` image carries it with the packages it imports; and
`write_run.py` renders that bundle: a run's status when it is not `completed`, its ignored content as a block
"sent by the client, not used", a compaction marker as a `## Compacted` section, and the AG-UI `index.md` columns.
An Open WebUI bundle renders byte-identically to before, pinned by a golden tree written by today's script. The
archive itself does not switch yet: `tasks/export.yml` and `tasks/write.yml` keep `write_agui_run.py` until
slice 3.

**Implements:** spec [§14](../../../specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/14-archive.md) *The Open WebUI chat* and
*Write*; decisions **15** (task 1's field-by-field tests and committed bundles, task 3's renders and second
render) and **16** (task 3: status, ignored block, Compacted section, Open WebUI byte-identical); inputs-for-plan
bullets 3 (the exporter runs in the image: task 2), 5 and 8 (the marker's rendering and the `Compactions` column
move into `write_run.py`: task 3).

**Review Focus** (plan README): item 5 is task 3's `test_title_with_a_pipe_and_a_heading`. Items 1–4 are slice
1's; nothing else here needs a case of its own.

**Branch:** `impl/agui-conversation-record-2-export`, from `main` after slice 1 **and** compaction #18 merged
(README, *Order against the compaction track*). Global constraints, shared interfaces and rulings:
[plan README](README.md). Paths are relative to the repository root unless a step `cd`s; `CHAT` means
`platform/agui/copilotkit-chat`, `ARCHIVE` `platform/ansible/roles/run_archive/files`, `FIXTURES`
`platform/dev/tests/fixtures/agui-record`.

**Verified facts this slice builds on** (read in the repo and `CHAT/node_modules`, 2026-11-03):

- Next's standalone output bundles `@ag-ui/client` and `rxjs` into the server's chunks: a built
  `.next/standalone/node_modules` holds neither (checked in a standalone build of the compaction worktree). A
  script run with `node` in the image therefore cannot import them unless the Dockerfile adds them.
- `npm query ':root > #@ag-ui/client, :root > #@ag-ui/client *, :root > #rxjs, :root > #rxjs *'` (npm 11.19,
  Node 24.21) lists the top-level `@ag-ui/client` 1.0.2, `@ag-ui/core|encoder|proto` 1.0.2 (two nested `zod`),
  `@bufbuild/protobuf`, `@protobuf-ts/protoc`, `@types/uuid`, `compare-versions`, `fast-json-patch`, `rxjs` 7.8.1,
  `tslib`, `untruncate-json`, `uuid`, `zod`: 38 MB. Copied with `cp -a --parents` into an empty directory, a plain
  `node` ESM file there imports `defaultApplyEvents`, `HttpAgent`, `EventType` and `rxjs`'s `of`.
- `CHAT/.dockerignore` is an allowlist (`*`, then `!app/`, `!lib/`, …) that excludes `lib/*.test.ts` and
  `lib/test-*.ts`; `scripts/` is not in the build context today. `next build` type-checks every `**/*.ts` the
  context holds (`tsconfig.json` `include`), so `scripts/export-journals.ts` is type-checked once it is copied in.
- `CHAT/Dockerfile`: build stage l. 3–12 (`COPY app`, `lib`, `instrumentation.ts`, `RUN npm run build`); runtime
  l. 14–30, standalone and static copied l. 21–22, `/data/sessions` created l. 26; the runtime runs as `node`
  (uid 1000). `package.json` has no `"type"`: Node runs a `.ts` file as ESM by syntax detection with the
  `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning, which `npm test` disables with `--disable-warning`.
- `@ag-ui/client` 1.0.2's event application: `TOOL_CALL_START` with a `parentMessageId` that no message has
  creates an assistant message with that id and the call (`xe()` in `dist/index.mjs`); `REASONING_MESSAGE_START`
  creates `{id, role: "reasoning", content: ""}`; `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` creates `{id: messageId, role: "tool",
  toolCallId, content}`.
- `ARCHIVE/write_run.py`: `main(argv)` l. 94–163 takes `<bundle> <run dir> <report title>`, copies the bundle to
  `<run dir>/openwebui-export.json` l. 101–103 (skipped when re-rendering in place), then renders notes, chats and
  `index.md`; `active_branch` l. 35, `fence` l. 46, `texts` l. 54, `render_message` l. 60 (assistant text raw, not
  fenced), `when` l. 26 (epoch seconds, ms or ns; not ISO). No test renders an Open WebUI bundle today.
- A trial of tasks 1–2 (this file's `export.ts`, script, Dockerfile and `.dockerignore`, with a stand-in rebuild)
  built the image, ran the exporter in it on the fixture journals (the bundle equal to the committed one but
  `exported_at`; a wrong mode exits 2), and the server answered `200` on `/`.
- `platform/dev/tests/test_write_agui_run.py` loads the scripts by `importlib` and runs them by `subprocess`; this
  slice's tests do the same.

### Step 0: the gate, and the claim

- [ ] **Check that compaction #18 merged.**

```bash
gh pr view 18 --repo thodkatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test --json state -q .state
```

  Expected: `MERGED`. Anything else: do not start. Comment once on this track's last merged PR (the plan's
  slice 1 PR) that slice 2 waits for #18, then end the session with
  `.methodology/shared/claude/next-session.sh --end --blocked 18` (README, *Order against the compaction
  track*). The next session starts here again.

- [ ] **Claim.** From the main checkout, after `git fetch origin`: `.methodology/shared/claude/worktree.sh
  impl/agui-conversation-record-2-export`, push the branch, and open the draft PR `AG-UI record: exporter in the
  image, write_run.py renders AG-UI chats (2/4)` with `gh pr create --repo thodkatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test
  --base main --draft` (`AGENTS.md`, *Development workflow*). Read slice 1's merged `lib/journal.ts` and
  `lib/rebuild.ts` exports: if a name or signature differs from the README's *Shared interfaces*, use what merged
  and record the difference as a ruling in this slice's handoff.

### Task 1: `lib/export.ts`, on committed fixture journals

**Files:**
- Create: `CHAT/lib/export.ts`, `CHAT/lib/export.test.ts`
- Create: `FIXTURES/00000000-0000-4000-8000-00000000000{1..5}.jsonl`,
  `FIXTURES/00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000009.json`, `FIXTURES/live.bundle.json`, `FIXTURES/final.bundle.json`
  (the last two generated)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `idOfJournal`, `parseJournal`, `Ignored` (`lib/journal.ts`); `rebuild`, `Conversation`, `RunView`
  (`lib/rebuild.ts`); `autoTitle` (`lib/sessions.ts`, §6's title rule, kept by slice 3).
- Produces: the README's `ArchiveMode`, `OpenWebUIChat`, `Bundle`, `toOpenWebUIChat`, `exportJournals`, with
  `chat.history.messages` typed as `Record<string, ExportedMessage>`; plus `exportJournals`'s optional third
  argument `{ now?: () => Date }` (the fixtures' `exported_at`), `bundleJson(bundle)` (the file's exact text,
  shared by the script and the fixtures), `runMessageId(runId)` (`spe-run-<run id>`, a run's exported assistant
  message), `outputItems(message)`, `ExportedMessage`, `OutputItem`, `SpeRun`. Task 2's script and task 3's
  tests use the bundles.

The fixture sessions, one journal each:

| Id ending | Session | What it exercises |
|---|---|---|
| `…0001` | "List the home directory" | reasoning, a tool call and its result (a four-backtick run), text; tags; two runs |
| `…0002` | "hello" | all four ignored kinds, including a forged `spe-compaction-` marker; a refused run with a `deleted` entry |
| `…0003` | "run a slow command", hidden | `failed`, `cancelled`, `aborted`, and `incomplete` with a torn last line |
| `…0004` | "first question", deleted | two concurrent runs from one anchor (siblings, interleaved lines); a compaction marker |
| `…0005` | a title with a pipe, brackets, a newline, `#` and `<script>` | Review Focus 5; tags with `|` and HTML |
| `…0009.json` | an old-format session file | not a journal: skipped |

- [ ] **Step 1: the fixture journals.** Create each file under `FIXTURES/` with exactly these lines, each ending
  in a newline (one JSON object per line, as `JournalWriter` writes them):

    chat: { title, history: { messages, currentId }, messages: branch },
  };
}

// Every <uuid>.jsonl in `dir`, hidden and deleted sessions included; any other file is not a journal.
export async function exportJournals(dir: string, mode: ArchiveMode,
  opts: { now?: () => Date } = {}): Promise<Bundle> {
  const names = (await fs.readdir(dir)).filter((name) => idOfJournal(name) !== null).sort();
  const chats: OpenWebUIChat[] = [];
  for (const name of names) {
    const { lines } = parseJournal(await fs.readFile(path.join(dir, name), "utf8"));

export function bundleJson(bundle: Bundle): string {
  return JSON.stringify(bundle, null, 1) + "\n";
}
```


- [ ] **Step 5: write the bundles, read them, run again.**

```bash
(cd platform/agui/copilotkit-chat && UPDATE_FIXTURES=1 npm test; npm test)
```

  Expected: both runs pass. Before going on, read
  `FIXTURES/live.bundle.json` once against the table above: five chats; `…0001`'s run `r1-1` has the four items
  in the order reasoning, `function_call`, `function_call_output`, `message`; `…0002`'s `spe-run-r2-3` has no
  output and `spe_ignored` `[{kind: "deleted", message: "a2"}]`; `…0003`'s last run is `incomplete` with
  `content` `"Still go"`; `…0004`'s `currentId` is `spe-run-r4-2`. Task 3's expectations are written against
  exactly these bundles: if one differs because slice 1's rebuild reads an event differently, the rebuild is the
  reference (decision 11), so record what differs in the handoff and adjust task 3's expected strings, not the
  rebuild.

- [ ] **Step 6: commit.** `(cd CHAT && npm run build)` passes (it type-checks `lib/export.ts`).

```bash
git add platform/agui/copilotkit-chat/lib/export.ts platform/agui/copilotkit-chat/lib/export.test.ts \
  platform/dev/tests/fixtures/agui-record
git status --short   # only the files above, the nine fixture files included
git commit -s -m "Chat: export a rebuilt session as an Open WebUI chat

One assistant message per run, its AG-UI messages as Open WebUI output items in
the order they first appeared, with spe_run and spe_ignored. Fixture journals
cover every status, ignored kind, sibling branches, a compaction and a torn
line; the bundles exported from them are committed for write_run.py's tests."
```

### Task 2: `scripts/export-journals.ts` in the `chat-ui` image

**Files:**
- Create: `CHAT/scripts/export-journals.ts`
- Modify: `CHAT/Dockerfile` (build stage l. 10–12; runtime l. 21–22), `CHAT/.dockerignore` (one line)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `exportJournals`, `bundleJson` (task 1).
- Produces: `node scripts/export-journals.ts <journals dir> <bundle.json> <live|final>` in the image's `/app`,
  exit 0 and one line `N sessions (H hidden, D deleted), <mode> archive`; exit 2 and the usage on stderr for wrong
  arguments; exit 1 and the error's message on a read or write failure. Slice 3's `tasks/export.yml` runs it as
  the README's *Shared interfaces* shows.

**How the script gets its packages.** The standalone output has neither `@ag-ui/client` nor `rxjs` (verified
facts). The build stage, which has the full `node_modules` from `npm ci`, asks npm for both packages' dependency
closure (`npm query`, from the installed tree and so from the lock file) and copies it, `lib/*.ts` and the script
into `/exporter/`; the runtime stage copies `/exporter/` over `/app`, so `/app/node_modules` gains the closure
beside the standalone's traced packages. Both come from the same lock file, so a package both hold is the same
version, and the server's own chunks do not read these files. Cost: about 44 MB in the image (441 MB → 485 MB in a trial build).

- [ ] **Step 1: write the failing test.** Append to `CHAT/lib/export.test.ts` (its `execFileP` and `CHAT` are
  already declared at the top):

```ts

test("the command writes the bundle; a wrong mode is refused", async () => {
  const dir = await fs.mkdtemp(path.join(os.tmpdir(), "export-cli-"));
  const out = path.join(dir, "bundle.json");
  const node = [process.execPath, "--disable-warning=MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON", "scripts/export-journals.ts"];
  const { stdout } = await execFileP(node[0], [...node.slice(1), FIXTURES, out, "final"], { cwd: CHAT });
  assert.equal(stdout, "5 sessions (1 hidden, 1 deleted), final archive\n");
  const written = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(out, "utf8")) as Bundle;
  const fixture = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(path.join(FIXTURES, "final.bundle.json"), "utf8")) as Bundle;
  assert.deepEqual({ ...written, exported_at: 0 }, { ...fixture, exported_at: 0 });
  await assert.rejects(execFileP(node[0], [...node.slice(1), FIXTURES, out, "weekly"], { cwd: CHAT }),
    (err: { code?: number; stderr?: string }) => err.code === 2 && /^usage: /.test(err.stderr ?? ""));
});
```

  Run `(cd CHAT && npm test)`. Expected: this test fails (`Cannot find module …/scripts/export-journals.ts`).

- [ ] **Step 2: the script.** Create `CHAT/scripts/export-journals.ts`:

```ts
// Exports every session journal in a directory as one Open WebUI-shaped bundle, for the archive (spec §14):
//   node scripts/export-journals.ts <journals dir> <bundle.json> <live|final>
// The archive runs it in the chat-ui image, in a one-off container. It reads the journals and writes only the bundle.
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import { bundleJson, exportJournals } from "../lib/export.ts";

export const USAGE = "usage: node scripts/export-journals.ts <journals dir> <bundle.json> <live|final>";

export async function main(argv: string[]): Promise<number> {
  const [dir, out, mode] = argv;
  if (argv.length !== 3 || (mode !== "live" && mode !== "final")) {
    console.error(USAGE);
    return 2;
  }
  const bundle = await exportJournals(dir, mode);
  await fs.writeFile(out, bundleJson(bundle));
  const deleted = bundle.chats.filter((c) => c.meta.spe_deleted_at !== undefined).length;
  const hidden = bundle.chats.filter((c) => c.archived && c.meta.spe_deleted_at === undefined).length;
  console.log(`${bundle.chats.length} sessions (${hidden} hidden, ${deleted} deleted), ${mode} archive`);
  return 0;
}

if (process.argv[1] !== undefined && path.resolve(process.argv[1]) === fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)) {
  main(process.argv.slice(2)).then(
    (code) => { process.exitCode = code; },
    (err: unknown) => { console.error(err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)); process.exitCode = 1; },
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: run the tests and the build.** `(cd CHAT && npm ci && npm test && npm run build)`. Expected: all
  pass; the build type-checks the script.

- [ ] **Step 4: the image.** Add `!scripts/export-journals.ts` as the last line of `CHAT/.dockerignore`. In
  `CHAT/Dockerfile`'s build stage, add the script beside `lib` and collect the exporter after the build, so
  l. 10–12 become:

```dockerfile
COPY lib ./lib
COPY scripts/export-journals.ts ./scripts/
COPY instrumentation.ts ./
RUN npm run build
# The journal exporter (scripts/export-journals.ts) runs outside the server, in a one-off container. The
# standalone output bundles @ag-ui/client and rxjs into the server's chunks and leaves them out of its
# node_modules, so collect what the exporter imports: lib/ and both packages with their dependencies, as
# npm installed them from the lock file.
RUN mkdir -p /exporter/lib /exporter/scripts \
 && npm query ':root > #@ag-ui/client, :root > #@ag-ui/client *, :root > #rxjs, :root > #rxjs *' \
    | node -e 'let s = ""; process.stdin.on("data", (d) => (s += d)).on("end", () => { for (const p of JSON.parse(s)) console.log(p.location); })' \
    | xargs -r cp -a --parents -t /exporter \
 && cp lib/*.ts /exporter/lib/ \
 && cp scripts/export-journals.ts /exporter/scripts/
```

  and in the runtime stage, after the two `COPY --from=build` lines (l. 21–22):

```dockerfile
# The exporter's files merge into the standalone tree: same lock file, so a package both hold is the same version.
COPY --from=build --chown=root:root /exporter/ ./
```

- [ ] **Step 5: build it and run the exporter in it.**

```bash
cd platform/agui/copilotkit-chat
docker build -t spe-chat-ui:export-check .
out=$(mktemp -d)
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --entrypoint node \
  -v "$PWD/../../dev/tests/fixtures/agui-record:/in:ro" -v "$out:/out" \
  spe-chat-ui:export-check scripts/export-journals.ts /in /out/bundle.json final
python3 - "$out/bundle.json" ../../dev/tests/fixtures/agui-record/final.bundle.json <<'EOF'
import json, sys
built, fixture = (json.load(open(p)) for p in sys.argv[1:3])
built["exported_at"] = fixture["exported_at"] = 0
assert built == fixture, "the image's export differs from the committed bundle"
print("the image exports the committed bundle")
EOF
docker run --rm --entrypoint node spe-chat-ui:export-check scripts/export-journals.ts /in /out/x.json weekly; echo "exit $?"
```

  Expected: `5 sessions (1 hidden, 1 deleted), final archive` (with the `MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON` warning on
  stderr), `the image exports the committed bundle`, then the usage line and `exit 2`. `--user` lets the
  container write into `$out`; slice 3's task gives `/out` to uid 1000 or passes `--user` the same way.

- [ ] **Step 6: the server still starts.**

```bash
cid=$(docker run -d --rm -e AGENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9 -e AGENT_API_KEY=unused -p 127.0.0.1:13000:3000 \
  spe-chat-ui:export-check)
for i in $(seq 30); do curl -sf -o /dev/null http://127.0.0.1:13000/ && break; sleep 1; done
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:13000/
docker stop "$cid"; docker image ls spe-chat-ui:export-check --format '{{.Size}}'
docker rmi spe-chat-ui:export-check
```

  Expected: `200`; the size is the previous image's plus about 44 MB (`docker image ls` on the dev VM shows the
  deployed one). Note the two sizes in the PR body.

  **If step 5 fails** with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for a package `P`: `P` is outside the queried closure (a peer
  dependency npm does not walk). Add `, :root > #P, :root > #P *` to the query and rebuild. **If `npm query`
  itself fails** in the build: replace the `RUN mkdir -p /exporter …` step's query pipeline with the whole
  production tree, `RUN npm prune --omit=dev && mkdir -p /exporter/lib /exporter/scripts && cp -a node_modules
  /exporter/ && cp lib/*.ts /exporter/lib/ && cp scripts/export-journals.ts /exporter/scripts/` (after the
  build, so the build keeps its dev dependencies), measure the image again, and record the choice and the size
  as a ruling in the handoff. Either way, the run in step 5 is the check.

- [ ] **Step 7: commit.**

```bash
git add platform/agui/copilotkit-chat/scripts/export-journals.ts platform/agui/copilotkit-chat/Dockerfile \
  platform/agui/copilotkit-chat/.dockerignore
git commit -s -m "Chat image: ship the journal exporter

scripts/export-journals.ts writes the archive's bundle from a journals
directory. The standalone output bundles @ag-ui/client and rxjs into the
server's chunks, so the image copies both packages' dependency closure, as npm
installed it from the lock file, and lib/ for the script to import."
```

### Task 3: `write_run.py` renders AG-UI chats; Open WebUI stays byte-identical

**Files:**
- Create: `platform/dev/tests/fixtures/openwebui-run/bundle.json`, `platform/dev/tests/fixtures/openwebui-run/expected/`
  (generated by today's script), `platform/dev/tests/test_write_run_agui.py`
- Modify: `ARCHIVE/write_run.py` (docstring; new functions before `main`; one branch in `main` after l. 103)
- Modify: `docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/clarifications.md`, `docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/14-archive.md` (*Write*)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `FIXTURES/live.bundle.json`, `final.bundle.json` (task 1); `fence`, `texts`, `active_branch`, `when`,
  `slug`, `write` (`write_run.py`).
- Produces: the README's `is_compaction(item_or_message)`, `render_ignored(entries) -> str`,
  `render_status(run) -> str`; `write_agui(bundle, run_dir)`, called by `main` for a bundle with
  `spe_archive_mode`. It reads `agent-runs.jsonl` and `agui-journals/` **from the run directory**: slice 3's
  `tasks/write.yml` puts them there before it runs `write_run.py`, so a re-render in place finds them too. The
  bundle is copied to `<run dir>/openwebui-export.json` as for Open WebUI, so the re-render command in the
  docstring is the same for both.

**What an AG-UI chat file looks like.** Everything in an AG-UI bundle came from a participant or a model, so the
renderer escapes or fences all of it: user and assistant text, tool results and reasoning in fences one backtick
longer than any run inside (`fence`); titles, tags, roles and statuses through `md_inline` (one line, Markdown
punctuation backslash-escaped, which a table cell needs for `|` and a heading for `#` and `<`); ids and tool names
as code spans. The order per run is the user turn, then the ignored block if any (it was sent with that turn),
then `## assistant`, its status line if not `completed`, then its output items. After the active branch comes
`## Other branches`: every other message in record order, each naming the message it follows, so a refused
run's ignored content and status (never on the tip's branch, §13) and a sibling branch from a second tab are in
the file too. That section is not in §14 *Write*'s text yet: step 7 adds it as a clarification.

- [ ] **Step 1: pin today's Open WebUI output first.** Create `platform/dev/tests/fixtures/openwebui-run/bundle.json`
  (two chats, one with a branch and every output item type, one falling back to `chat.messages`; a run report
  note and another note; a tag id without a name; a millisecond `updated_at`):

```json

             "timestamp": 1793700030}
     }
    }
   }
  }
 ]
}
```

  With `write_run.py` **unchanged**, write the golden tree:

```bash
python3 platform/ansible/roles/run_archive/files/write_run.py \
  platform/dev/tests/fixtures/openwebui-run/bundle.json platform/dev/tests/fixtures/openwebui-run/expected "Run report"
```

  Expected: `2 chats, report filled in`, and `expected/` holds `index.md`, `report.md`, `notes/scratch-notes.md`,
  `openwebui-export.json` and `chats/01-list-the-home-directory.{md,json}`, `chats/02-second-chat-b.{md,json}`.

- [ ] **Step 2: the test file, with the byte-identical test.** Create `platform/dev/tests/test_write_run_agui.py`:

```python

- [ ] **Step 4: run them to see them fail.** `uv run --with pytest pytest platform/dev/tests/test_write_run_agui.py -q`.
  Expected: the byte-identical test passes; the others fail (no AG-UI branch: `write_run.py` renders the bundle
  as Open WebUI, and `test_helpers` fails on the missing `is_compaction`).

- [ ] **Step 5: implement.** In `ARCHIVE/write_run.py`, change the docstring's first paragraph to:

```python
"""Turn an OpenWebUI export bundle into a readable run directory.

    write_run.py <bundle.json> <run dir> <report note title>

Can be re-run on an archived run to re-render it with a newer version of
this script: write_run.py <run dir>/openwebui-export.json <run dir> "Run report".

Writes report.md (the participant's "Run report" note), chats/NN-<title>.md
and .json (active branch of each chat, with tags), notes/ for any other
notes, index.md (overview) and openwebui-export.json (the raw bundle).

A bundle with spe_archive_mode is the AG-UI chat UI's export (one assistant
message per run, with spe_run and spe_ignored): write_agui() renders it
instead, escaping or fencing every text, with each run's status, its ignored
content and compaction markers; it links agui-journals/ and agent-runs.jsonl
when they are in the run directory. There is no report.
Stdlib only. write_agui_run.py imports slug() and fence() from here.
"""
```

  Insert before `def main(argv):`:

```python
# AG-UI bundles: the chat UI's exporter writes this same shape plus `spe_archive_mode` (live or final), one
# assistant message per run carrying `spe_run` (its status) and `spe_ignored` (what the client sent that was not

  pass, `test_write_agui_run.py` included (it imports `slug`, `fence`, `write`, which keep their behaviour).
  Open `chats/02-hello.md` and `chats/04-first-question.md` of one render (`python3 ARCHIVE/write_run.py
  FIXTURES/live.bundle.json /tmp/agui-run "Run report"`) and read them as a person analysing a run would: the
  ignored block sits between `continue` and `Continuing.`, the refused run is under *Other branches*, the
  compaction is a section of its own.

- [ ] **Step 7: the spec clarification.** In `docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/clarifications.md`, add
  the next free number, dated the day of the commit:

```markdown
N. **The archive's chat file also shows the messages off the active branch** (<date>; AG-UI conversation record,
   slice 2/4). `chats/NN-<slug>.md` renders the branch along `currentId`, then a section "Other branches" with
   every other message in record order, each naming the message it follows, with the same status lines and
   ignored blocks. *Reason:* a refused run adds no message, so it is never on the tip's branch, and two tabs
   make sibling branches; rendering only the active branch would hide a refused run's status and ignored
   content, which decision 16 says the archive shows. *Amends:* §14 *Write*. *Status:* folded.
```

  and in `14-archive.md`, *Write*, replace the tree's `chats/NN-<slug>.md` entry (two lines) with:

```
  chats/NN-<slug>.md          the active branch along currentId: user and assistant text, each tool call with
                              fenced arguments and result, plus the three additions below; then every message on
                              other branches, each naming the message it follows (clarification N)
```

- [ ] **Step 8: commit.**

```bash
git add platform/ansible/roles/run_archive/files/write_run.py platform/dev/tests/test_write_run_agui.py \
  docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/clarifications.md docs/specs/2026-10-15-agui-frontend-design/14-archive.md
git commit -s -m "Archive: write_run.py renders the AG-UI chat UI's bundle

A bundle with spe_archive_mode gets the AG-UI index (# | Session | Tags |
Created | Runs | Compactions | State, live or final), each run's status when not
completed, its ignored content as a 'sent by the client, not used' block, a
compaction marker as a Compacted section, and the messages off the active
branch. Every text is fenced or escaped. Open WebUI bundles are untouched."
```

### Finish the slice

- [ ] All checks, from the worktree: `(cd CHAT && npm ci && npm test && npm run build)`,
  `uv run --with pytest pytest platform/dev/tests -q`, task 2's step 5 run in the image,
  `python3 .methodology/shared/sync-agents.py --check`. No Ansible file changed, so no `--syntax-check` is needed; say so in the PR body.
- [ ] The README's slices table: row 2/4 `merged` (in the PR, as the last commit before the merge); `AGENTS.md`,
  *Current work*: the record's line says slice 2 merged, **next: slice 3/4** `impl/agui-conversation-record-3-route`.
- [ ] The handoff for slice 3 (`handoffs/<UTC stamp>-slice-2-merged-start-slice-3.md`): what changed against this
  file (rulings, e.g. task 1 step 5's differences or task 2's fallback), the image size, and for slice 3's
  `tasks/export.yml`: the exporter's command, that `/out` must be writable by uid 1000 or the run needs `--user`,
  and that `write_run.py` expects `agui-journals/` and `agent-runs.jsonl` in the run directory before it runs.
- [ ] PR body: what ran (the commands above, the image check's output, both image sizes), Review Focus 5's test,
  and the rendered `chats/02-hello.md` as a sample. Then the local review round (`AGENTS.md`, *Reviewers*:
  correctness and methodology), address every finding, mark ready, merge (`AGENTS.md`, *Overrides*), clean up
  the worktree and branch, move the pin in `biohackathon`, and start slice 3 with
  `.methodology/shared/claude/next-session.sh --next impl/agui-conversation-record-3-route <handoff>`.

## Notes for the plan author

*Folded into the README's Shared interfaces, File structure and clarifications on 2026-11-03; the notes stay as
the record of why.*

- **`ExportedMessage` and three helpers.** The README types `chat.history.messages` as `Record<string,
  unknown>`; this file types it as `Record<string, ExportedMessage>` (narrower, same JSON) and adds
  `exportJournals`'s optional `{ now }`, `bundleJson`, `runMessageId`, `outputItems`. Names in the README are
  unchanged; consider adding these to *Shared interfaces*.
- **A run's exported message id is `spe-run-<run id>`.** §14 does not name it; `currentId` and every `parentId`
  that points at a run use it.
- **`spe_run` carries no `error`.** *Folded by the plan author:* `spe_run` gains `error` (from `run_end.error`),
  and `render_status` appends it, escaped by `md_inline`, so a failed run's reason reaches the archive.
- **"Other branches" goes beyond §14's text** (task 3, step 7 adds clarification N): without it, a refused run's
  ignored content would be in no Markdown file. Slice 3's early-output sample shows it to the user.
- **The run's `content` leaves out a compaction marker's summary** (§14 says "the run's text joined"); the marker
  is kept as its own `message` item, so nothing is lost, and Open WebUI shows the reply without the summary.
- **The index's `Runs` column counts refused runs** (one assistant message each); `Compactions` counts markers on
  every branch.
