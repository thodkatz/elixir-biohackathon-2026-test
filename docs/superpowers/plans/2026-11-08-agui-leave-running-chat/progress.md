# Progress: verdicts and rulings

One entry per verdict or ruling made while building, newest last, each *decision, why, cost if wrong* with the
slice and date. The plan's own rulings are in [README.md](README.md), *Rulings*.

## Verdicts

### Decision 42's rejoin check: **live** (slice 1, 2026-11-08)

CopilotKit 1.84.1, `@ag-ui/client` 1.0.2, the fake agent; script and output in
[`evidence/slice-1/`](evidence/slice-1/) (`rejoin_check.py`; `rejoin-check.txt`, layer off;
`rejoin-check-dedupe.txt`, layer `every` and `wait`, its NOTE first).

- **B, the stop point: PASS.** A private agent shows an ordinary open, a remount and a send each id once, with no
  `connect` request; the gate does not apply.

      PASS B: no connect (open 0, remount 0); ids equal and once: open True, remount True, after send True; journal runs 4

  A (two private agents streaming at once) and D (stop in a rejoined chat journals `cancelled`) PASS too.
- **Without a layer, C1–C3 and E FAIL, on one thing only**: the first id list React commits after the connect is
  empty (`lengths in order: [0, 12, 12, …]`, at ms 0, for about 25–55 ms). No duplicate, the stream whole, the
  ids equal to `GET`'s at the end:

      FAIL C1: connects 1; duplicates 0; ids missing at some tick 0; committed lists with a duplicate 0, lacking a history id 1 of 14; slow steps shown at the end 10 of 10 (exactly 10: streamed whole, none repeated); equal to GET at the end True; runs ['completed', 'completed', 'completed']
      FAIL E: connects 1; duplicates 0; ids missing at some tick 0; committed lists with a duplicate 0, lacking a history id 1 of 12; slow steps shown at the end 10 of 10 (exactly 10: streamed whole, none repeated); equal to GET at the end True; runs ['completed', 'completed']

  (C2 and C3 alike: `lacking a history id 1 of 12` and `1 of 13`.) The cause: `CopilotKitCore.connectAgent`
  treats every rejoin from a freshly loaded page as a fresh restore and calls `agent.setMessages([])` before
  connecting (`@copilotkit/core/dist/index.mjs:4304`, `:4317`).
- **With the layer in its `every` form, C1–C3 and E PASS** (`rejoin-check-dedupe.txt`, run 1):

      PASS C1: connects 1; duplicates 0; ids missing at some tick 0; committed lists with a duplicate 0, lacking a history id 0 of 13; slow steps shown at the end 10 of 10 (exactly 10: streamed whole, none repeated); equal to GET at the end True; runs ['completed', 'completed', 'completed']
      PASS E: connects 1; duplicates 0; ids missing at some tick 0; committed lists with a duplicate 0, lacking a history id 0 of 13; slow steps shown at the end 10 of 10 (exactly 10: streamed whole, none repeated); equal to GET at the end True; runs ['completed', 'completed']

  (C2 `0 of 12`, C3 `0 of 14`.) Merging only from the replay's first event on (`wait`, run 2) FAILs all four on
  the same empty list (`lacking a history id 1 of 13`, `1 of 14`, `1 of 12`, `1 of 12`).
- **Verdict: live, replayed messages matched by id** (§6 *Opening a session*, decision 42 as written; no
  clarification). The mechanism slice 3 builds, as the page did:
  - **The run in progress** is the set of message ids the replay's events name since the last `RUN_STARTED` the
    subscriber saw: each event's `messageId` and `parentMessageId` (strings), collected in an `onEvent` subscriber
    on the agent, the set emptied on each `RUN_STARTED`. `connect` replays past runs first (compacted), then the
    running run from its own `RUN_STARTED`, whole (`@copilotkit/runtime` `v2/runtime/runner/in-memory.mjs:582`,
    a `ReplaySubject(Infinity)` at :471), so the last `RUN_STARTED` is the run in progress.
  - **The rule** (`rejoinedMessages`): keep the history in order; a history message whose id is in that set is
    replaced in place by the agent's copy; append the agent's messages whose id the history lacks; drop every
    other replayed copy.
  - **When it runs: on every message change while `connectAgent` lasts** (an `onMessagesChanged` subscriber,
    subscribed before `connectAgent` is called and from its first change, not from the replay's first event),
    **and once after it resolves**; it sets the messages only when the result differs (otherwise its own
    `setMessages` triggers it again). Why: the event pipeline works on its own clone of the agent's messages,
    taken when it starts (`@ag-ui/client` `apply/default.ts:143`, `structuredClone_(agent.messages)`), and writes
    it back on every event (`agent.ts:548`), so an outside `setMessages` lasts only to the next event; and only a
    merge on `connectAgent`'s own `setMessages([])` refills the history before React commits the empty list.
  - **The risk: an ordering race.** That merge must land after the pipeline's clone. Were it to land before, the
    history's partial copy of the running assistant message would sit in the clone and the replay's
    `TEXT_MESSAGE_START` on the same id would append to it (`default.ts:236–268`): its text repeated. It never
    did here (6 C cases, 2 E, two runs, 10 of 10 steps each), but it rests on how many awaits CopilotKit makes
    between `index.mjs:4317` and the clone, which an upgrade can change. What detects it: the streamed text shows
    each step once and grows through the run, ending on exactly the run's steps (the script's "exactly 10: none
    repeated", `SLOW_STEPS` in `platform/dev/fake_agent.py`); slice 3's Playwright acceptance keeps that check.
- **`connect` cost: one request per rejoin.** Each rejoin made one `GET /api/copilotkit/info` and one
  `POST /api/copilotkit/agent/spe/connect` (`connect requests from the rejoining page: 1` in C1–C3, D and E);
  an ordinary open and a remount made none (`connect requests on open: 0`, `on remount: 0`).

## Rulings while building

- **Slice 3, task 2's *Live* text names the verdict's mechanism** (slice 1, 2026-11-08). It now names the marker
  for the run in progress (a third argument of `rejoinedMessages`, `inProgress`), runs the merge on every message change during the connect and once after it resolves,
  and adds tests for a current run's tool call and result and a `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` during the replay, and a
  Playwright check that the streamed text grows during the run. *Why:* the check found `connectAgent` clears the
  messages first and a merge from the replay's first event on (`wait`) fails; task 2's review asked for the rest.
  *Cost if wrong:* the ordering race above makes a rejoined message repeat its text; the Playwright check shows it.
