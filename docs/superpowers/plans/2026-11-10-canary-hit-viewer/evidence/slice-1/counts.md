# Slice 1 early output: hit counts over the portal's archive (2026-11-10)

`canary_watch.py --archive` (slice 1 at `d3e56b7`) over all 51 runs in `/data-share/runs/` on the portal VM, run
with `sudo python3 -I` from a temporary copy (removed). Pages: `/data-share/canary-hits/early-output/<run>.html`
(regenerated at `f6c79e6`, quiet kinds collapsed under "also seen", same counts; root:root, dir 0750, files 0640; the portal has no `sperange-report` group, so root alone, ruling in the PR).
No `--api-host`: the archive keeps none and the instances' output directories are gone, so any URL host in a
call's arguments would count as `sent`; none did.

Runs with hits (kind/frontend: count). The other 45 have none: `2026-11-10T020630Z_cw-thodkatz-thodkatz-workspace`,
archived while the scan ran (51 pages, one per run, recounted after), has 0; 42 hold no journal, run log or chat with a
canary-bearing turn, and `cw-landfried-pr17-test` and `cw-landfried-upd-test` (one journal, four agent runs each)
leaked nothing.

Read against decisions 4, 5 and 11 (two runs, trace fields only): DRS metadata, TRS descriptions, service-info and
workflow comments in `read_file`/`get_process_status` results are `seen`; the registry study ids
(`sensitive/registry/linkage.csv`, a file canary) in `run_command`, `read_file` and `get_process_status` results are
`touched`; study ids written by `write_file` are `args`; every hit has session, run and prompt, and workspace and
owner from `report.json`. No `sent`, `prompt` or `delivered` hit in any run. Nothing surprising.
