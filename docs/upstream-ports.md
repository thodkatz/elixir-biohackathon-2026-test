# Upstream ports

Which fork commits with project changes have been decided for upstream (`Project-24-Elixir-Biohackathon-2026/Project-24-Elixir-Biohackathon-2026`, formerly `kraatz/elixir-biohackathon-2026-test`; `kraatz #<n>` is its PR number):
ported in an upstream PR, or not for upstream and why. Fork-only: upstream's history carries no fork hashes.
The procedure that reads and writes it: `docs/guides/contributing-upstream.md`.

One line per fork commit (the squash commit of a fork PR), oldest first, its sha abbreviated to 7 characters
(`git log --abbrev=7`, as the guide's step 1 prints it):

    - `<short sha>` <fork subject> → kraatz #<n> (open | merged | closed: <why>)
    - `<short sha>` <fork subject> → not for upstream: <why>

A fork commit with no line here is still a candidate (the guide's step 1). Lines are not pruned, since a removed
line puts its commit back on the candidate list; the one deletion is a `closed` line removed on purpose to offer
its commit again (the guide's step 7).
