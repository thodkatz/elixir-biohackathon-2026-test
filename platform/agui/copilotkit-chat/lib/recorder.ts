// The run route's hook: AG-UI middleware on the `spe` agent that keeps each session's journal. Per run it
// admits or refuses; classifies the client's history against the journal (lib/anchor.ts); writes run_start,
// fsynced, before the agent is called; sends the agent the journal's path plus the new messages; journals every
// event; and writes run_end before the terminal event is passed on (spec §13, *The run route*). A command run
// (/compact, spec §15) is journaled with run_start.command and no new message, is sent the path alone plus
// forwardedProps.spe_command, and always gets a snapshot of the path. One instance serves every clone of the
// agent, so all per-run state lives in the closure of run().
