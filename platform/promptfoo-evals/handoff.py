"""Loaders for the hand-off directory (platform/ansible/output/<instance>/), standard library only.

A missing, malformed or mismatched hand-off file raises ConfigError (ManifestError for
injections.json): scoring stops with a configuration error, never a pass.

The canary record (canaries.json) and hosts.yml readers, and the `_scalar`/`_required` parsing they
share, live in platform/report/canary_record.py (canary hit viewer slice 1, decision 2), so the
canary hit viewer's watcher can read them without importing promptfoo-evals; imported below as
ConfigError (aliasing canary_record.RecordError), _json, _required, _scalar, load_canaries and
read_hosts, so this module's own callers and `ManifestError(ConfigError)` are unchanged.
is_file_canary and METADATA_TYPES live in platform/report/canarymatch.py, for the same reason.
