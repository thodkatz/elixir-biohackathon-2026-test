"""The canary hit viewer's reader (spec *Watcher*, *How it pulls*). Sent alone on the watcher's SSH
connection, source on stdin, and run as root on the instance:

    sudo python3 - '<offsets JSON>'

Offsets: `{"journals": {"<session uuid>": <int>}, "agent_runs": <int>, "receiver": <int>,
"openwebui": <number>}` (a missing key is 0). Prints one JSON object to stdout:

    {"files": {"journal:<uuid>" | "agent_runs" | "receiver": {"size", "start", "end", "lines", "line_starts"}},
     "openwebui": {"rows": [{"id", "title", "updated_at", "chat"}], "max": <number>} | null,
     "missing": [str], "errors": [str]}

The four sources: AG-UI session journals (one file per session, `<chat-sessions mount>/*.jsonl`,
keyed `journal:<uuid>` where uuid is the file's stem), the agent's run log (`<agent-runs
mount>/runs.jsonl`, keyed `agent_runs`), the test receiver's request log
(`/var/lib/spe-eval-sink/requests.jsonl`, keyed `receiver`) and Open WebUI's chats
(`<open-webui-data mount>/webui.db`, keyed `openwebui`, read through sqlite3 rather than lines).
Volume mountpoints come from `docker volume inspect spe-frontend_<name> --format
'{{ .Mountpoint }}'`; a volume that does not exist (e.g. open-webui-data on an agui-only instance)
makes its source "missing", not an error. `missing` names the source that does not exist on this
instance: `sessions`, `agent_runs`, `receiver` or `openwebui`; a session simply having no journal
yet is not "missing" (the sessions directory exists, just empty). `errors` carries a source-level
read failure that is not "it does not exist", as `"<name>: <exception class>"` (e.g. Open WebUI's
`chat` table missing, or its database locked).

`start` is where reading began for a file source: 0 when the file is shorter than the given offset
(it was replaced), else the offset given. `end` is the offset just past the last complete line
returned; a partial last line (no trailing newline yet) is left for the next poll. `line_starts`
gives the byte offset in the file of each returned line (the lines are decoded with
errors="replace", so the caller cannot recompute it from them): the watcher re-reads an open run
from its `run_start` line's offset after a restart. The three file
sources share one 1 MiB budget per call: past it, a source with nothing read yet still gets its
first complete line (so one oversized line cannot stall every source behind it), but nothing
budgets it less than guaranteed. Open WebUI has its own 1 MiB budget on `chat` text, with the same
guarantee for its first row; rows are those with `updated_at >= offset` (whole seconds, so a chat
saved in the same second as the last row read is returned again — the caller's dedup keys drop the
repeat), ordered by it; `max` is the newest `updated_at` among the rows actually returned (not
necessarily every row past the offset, if the budget stopped early), so the next poll picks up
where this one left off.

The reader opens every file with `open(path, "rb")` and nothing else, and reads the Open WebUI
database over `sqlite3.connect(f"file:{path}?mode=ro", uri=True)`: strictly read-only (decision 1,
*Nothing on the instance changes*). The test override `SPE_READER_PATHS`, a JSON object
`{"sessions": dir, "agent_runs": file, "receiver": file, "webui_db": file}`, replaces the docker
volume lookup (and the receiver's otherwise-fixed path) entirely; a key it omits or sets to null
behaves exactly like a volume that does not exist.

Standard library only, and no import of anything else in this repository: the reader is sent on its
own and has no `__file__` to find the rest of the checkout from.
